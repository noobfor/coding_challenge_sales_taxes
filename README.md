# coding_challenge_sales_taxes


I assumed that the import tax is applicable on all products

I assumed that the rounding is being applied for each tax and not overall.

Because the example shopping baskets didnt put more than one of each product in the list, I did not cover the case if there is more than one of one product being added.

For the rounding rules I assumed that because of the sales tax of 10%, rounding is being done by (10 * p)/100 and rounded up to the nearest 0.05
